    "1201": "Ah, the forest hides many secrets… and I? I’ve stolen a few. These Gems, they’re not mine, but Titania has more than she needs. You’ve something I crave: Olive Bread, warm and rich. Trade with me, and I might whisper tales of glowing eyes in the dark, wings that shimmer at moonrise, and dragons that speak in riddles. Keep an ear open, and a dagger close.",
    "1202": "My bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep... but he is gone, and all that remains is a portrait and pain. Angelo took both. Bring me Romeo’s likeness, torn from my chamber, and I’ll give you Tulips red as the blood spilt on Verona’s stones. Let this be our new balcony: you below, bearing justice.",
    "1203": "Give me life, give me love, but most of all... give me Port! In exchange, a sprig of Feverfew, dearer than gold to some, especially that wide-eyed Helena. Says she’s after crowns and legends, poor girl. Me? I’m after a full belly and a gentle nap. ‘Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack,’ they once told me. Ha! They were not wrong.",
    "1204": "Here’s rosemary, for remembrance—and nightshade, for regrets. My potions are not for the faint of will. With the right leaf, I can mend your limbs or muddle your tongue. ‘I do remember an apothecary,’ said a boy once, and he paid the price. But you? You look wiser. Bring me rare roots and bitter seeds, and I’ll mix you something worth the danger.",
    "1205": "Something is rotten, still. I feel it in the soil. I once ruled, loved, lost. Helena burned through me like summer lightning. And Leontes? He could not forgive the thaw. ‘The lady doth protest too much,’ they said; let them. If you see Helena, tell her the roses know her name. If you see Leontes, tell him I have not forgotten the winter.",
    "1206": "My grief is a statue; silent, but never still. I buried my crown in snow the day Gertrude chose her garden over me. ‘Exit, pursued by a bear’? No, I fled myself. Now I wait, among stone and silence. Bring me what was once mine, the King’s Crown, and I’ll pay in Gold, more than the weight of memory. But beware: some thrones carry curses.",
    "1207": "This bridge is mine, by Sycorax my mother.’ Prospero tried to steal it with spells and smiles. They called me beast, but I am of earth and storm, born to wild truth. I trade bones for Silver, tokens of the dead for coin of the living. Touch nothing lightly in these woods. Bring me what others fear, and I shall make you rich... or haunted.",
